## How can I contribute?

### Submit an issue

Submitting an issue, be it a bug report or a feature request, is one of the best ways to contribute to this project.

Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates, we'd rather work on improving Notable than deal with duplicates.

### Improve issues

Some issues are created with missing information ([`needs more info`](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22needs+more+info%22)), are not reproducible, or are plain duplicates. Help us finding reproducible steps and closing duplicates.

### Comment on issues

We are always looking for more opinions, leaving a comment in the issue tracker is a good opportunity to influence the future direction of Notable.

We also consider the number of ":+1:" an issue has when deciding if we are going to work on it in the [Next milestone](https://github.com/notable/notable/milestone/1) or not, so be sure to add your ":+1:" to the issues you're most interested in.

### Join the subreddit

We have a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/notable). Feel free to join us there, discussions not strictly related to the issue tracker are done there.

### Become a sponsor

At least until Notable becomes self-sustaining I plan to maintain a [Sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/fabiospampinato) on GitHub, feel free to support me there.

### Submit a pull request

Even though newer versions of the app are no longer open-source I should still be able to port over most PRs you might want to submit against any of the published open-source versions. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/notable/notable/blob/master/SOURCE_CODE.md).
