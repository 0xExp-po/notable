# Source code

Notable was originally released as open-source but newer versions of it are no longer open-source.

## Newer versions

Notable has effectively become my full-time job, so I've decided to figure out how to make it sustainable first before figuring out potentially how to license it, in order to make this less risky for me.

The source code for newer versions of the app is therefore unavailable, but many core libraries used in it are released under the [notable](https://github.com/notable?type=source) organization and [my profile](https://github.com/fabiospampinato?tab=repositories&type=source).

## Older versions

The source code for older versions of the app is still available:

- **v1.0.0..v1.3.0**: These initial releases have been published under the permissive MIT license, you can find v1.3.0's source code [here](https://github.com/notable/notable/tree/v1.3.0).
- **v1.4.0..v1.5.1**: These later releases have been published under the slightly less permissive AGPL-v3 license, you can find v1.5.1's source code [here](https://github.com/notable/notable/tree/v1.5.1).

You can find instructions on how to compile each version inside its respective `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
